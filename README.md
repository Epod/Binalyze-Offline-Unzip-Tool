# Binalyze Offline Unzip Utility
This tool can be used to extract encrypted ZIPs generated by Binalyze Offline Collectors without the need of uploading data to the Binalyze server.
The end result allowed you to extract your data entirely without internet access, or connectivity to any Binalyze server - a requirement for most offline analysis labs. 

The ZIPs require that the Binalize License Key be provided as this is a unique string used when the collectors encrypt the ZIPs.

## Flags
```
Usage:
  bin_unzip [command]

Available Commands:
  getpass     Only export the list of Binalyze ZIP Passwords
  help        Help about any command
  unzip       Finds and Extracts Binalyze Offline Collector ZIPs

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for bin_unzip
  -i, --input string      Path to folder containing zips. Defaults to scanning the same directory the program is running from (default "./")
  -k, --key string        The license key for the Binalyze instance which generated the Offline-Collector. (Required)
  -o, --output string     Folder name or full path to write results to. Defaults to "output" in current directory (default "output")
  -p, --password string   If the Offline Collector was generated with the "Encrypt Evidence" setting, provide that here.

Use "bin_unzip [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Instructions

Below are common scenarios and instructions for leveraging the program

### Functions
#### List ZIP Passwords
> command: getpass

The following will generate the password each Binalyze Offline Collector ZIP is encrypted with, without the need to upload or communicate to any server. 

```
This will only export the passwords for the ZIPs provided. 
This is useful if you are looking to unzip the Binalyze Offline Collector ZIPs using another method outside this program. 
For example:

bin_unzip getpass --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY
bin_unzip getpass --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY --csv

Usage:
  bin_unzip getpass --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY [flags]

Flags:
      --csv    Set to create a CSV containing the collected ZIP Passwords.
  -h, --help   help for getpass

Global Flags:
  -i, --input string      Path to folder containing zips. Defaults to scanning the same directory the program is running from (default "./")
  -k, --key string        The license key for the Binalyze instance which generated the Offline-Collector. (Required)
  -o, --output string     Folder name or full path to write results to. Defaults to "output" in current directory (default "output")
  -p, --password string   If the Offline Collector was generated with the "Encrypt Evidence" setting, provide that here.

```
#### Extract ZIPs
> command: unzip

The following will allow you to quickly extract all ZIPs generated by Binalyze Offline Collector in a directory. 

```
This will find and extract all Binalyze Offline Collector ZIP files. 
By default, this will look for ZIPs within the current folder, and output the results to the folder "output". 
These options are configurable. For example:

unzip --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY --input customzipfolder --output customextractfolder

unzip --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY --input customzipfolder

Usage:
  bin_unzip unzip --key BINALYZE-LICENSE-KEY [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for unzip

Global Flags:
  -i, --input string      Path to folder containing zips. Defaults to scanning the same directory the program is running from (default "./")
  -k, --key string        The license key for the Binalyze instance which generated the Offline-Collector. (Required)
  -o, --output string     Folder name or full path to write results to. Defaults to "output" in current directory (default "output")
  -p, --password string   If the Offline Collector was generated with the "Encrypt Evidence" setting, provide that here.
```
